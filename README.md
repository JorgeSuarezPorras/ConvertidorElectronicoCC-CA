#Electronic Converter DC-AC
In this repository you will find all the files contained in the project: CURRENT CONTROL IN A DC-AC ELECTRONIC CONVERTER VIA MICROCONTROLLER.

It is recommended to read the detailed information of the project contained in the file: BachelorThesis.pdf


# Steps
The files are available in Matlab R2019a version.
## Steps to simulate the converter:
Once the folder is downloaded, you must:
1. Run: Software_Matlab.m
2. Open: Simulador_Simulink.slx
3. In the Simulador_Simulink.slx file, modify the mask with the necessary values and execute the program (RUN).


## Steps to run the programs in the converter:
Once the folder is downloaded, you must:
1. Run: Software_Matlab.m
2. Open: VSC_Simulink.slx
3. In the Simulator_Simulink.slx file, modify the mask with the necessary values and run the program (Deploy to Hardware)
4. It is important not to be feeding the microcontroller at 48V. If not, it would give an error.
